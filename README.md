This project includes a script that reproduces some of the experiments
detailed in the paper *Principal Component Regression predicts
fuctional responses across individuals* by Bertrand Thirion, GaÃ«l
Varoquaux, Olivier Grisel, Cyril Poupon and Philippe Pinel, accepted
at the MICCAI 2014 conference.

Note however that the experiments are performed on a unique session,
hence break the independence assumption discussed in the
afoer-mentioned paper.
